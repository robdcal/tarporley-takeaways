# Tarporley Takeaways

A small hobby project when learning React.

When COVID struck, many small businesses - especially in rural areas - had to adapt. For food & drink businesses, this meant offering takeaway and delivery.

This project was designed to highlight the local businesses in and around Tarporley who were offering takeaways, helping them get exposure in a tough time.
